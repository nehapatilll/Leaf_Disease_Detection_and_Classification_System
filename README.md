# Leaf_Disease_Detection_and_Classification_System
Develop an model to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves based on images.
The system should differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by various diseases, such as fungal , viral, bacterial infections, nutrient deficiencies, or environmental stressors.

# Our Goal🎯
Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

# Dataset🗂️ 
Source:[ New Plant Diseases Dataset(Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

Content:
1. 38 classes (plant-disease pairs)
2. 14 unique plants
3. 87,867 images for training

# Data Exploration📊 
visualizing the class distribution and showcasing diverse disease samples.                                                                                                                                         This helps understand data balance and disease variations.
