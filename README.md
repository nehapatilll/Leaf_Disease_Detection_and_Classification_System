# Leaf_Disease_Detection_and_Classification_System 
Designed an ML-based Plant leaf disease detection and classification system using Python, image processing and advanced Resnet, a type of CNN algorithm.

The system should differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by various diseases, such as fungal , viral, bacterial infections, nutrient deficiencies, or environmental stressors.

# Our Goal🎯
Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

# Dataset📊
