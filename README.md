# Leaf_Disease_Detection_and_Classification_System


# Our Goal🎯
Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

# Dataset🗂️ 
Source:[ New Plant Diseases Dataset(Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

Content:
1. 38 classes (plant-disease pairs)
2. 14 unique plants
3. 87,867 images for training

# Data Exploration📊 
visualizing the class distribution and showcasing diverse disease samples. 

This helps understand data balance and disease variations.
