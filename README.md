# Leaf_Disease_Detection_and_Classification_System 🍃
Designed an ML-based Plant leaf disease detection and classification system using Python, image processing and advanced Resnet, a type of CNN algorithm.

The system should differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by various diseases, such as fungal , viral, bacterial infections, nutrient deficiencies, or environmental stressors.

# Our Goal🎯
Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

# Dataset🗂️ 
Source:[ New Plant Diseases Dataset(Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

Content:
• 38 classes (plant-disease pairs)
• 14 unique plants
• 87,867 images for training

# Data Exploration📊 
• visualizing the class distribution and showcasing diverse disease samples.                                                                                                                                          • This helps understand data balance and disease variations.
